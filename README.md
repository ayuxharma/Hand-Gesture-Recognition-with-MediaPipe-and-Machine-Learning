# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-with-MediaPipe-and-Machine-Learning
This project implements a real-time hand gesture recognition system using Google's MediaPipe and machine learning techniques. It captures hand landmarks from video input, extracts features, and classifies gestures using a trained machine learning model.
